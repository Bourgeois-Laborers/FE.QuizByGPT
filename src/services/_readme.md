# Services

## Overview

This `services` directory is an essential part of our Vue application architecture. It contains all the service classes or functions that interact with external APIs, databases, or other services. These services are responsible for data fetching, processing, and handling API requests and responses. The main goal of this structure is to abstract and encapsulate all the business logic related to external interactions, making our Vue components cleaner and more maintainable.

## Structure

Each service in this directory should be a standalone, modular file that exports a class or a set of functions. The services should be named clearly and descriptively, reflecting the external resource or data they handle.

## Usage

To use a service, import it into your Vue component or composable, and invoke its methods to perform data operations. Ensure that the service's responsibilities are adhered to, and avoid adding component-specific logic into these services.
